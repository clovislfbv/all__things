## Working on the game

### Cloning the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:clovislfbv/all_things-my-Discord-bot.git
```

Now, you're good to go!

### Workflow with branches

DON'T COMMIT OR PUSH TO MASTER

Create a new branch for each "feature".

It is recommended to create your new branch from master.
Little tutorial:
- Go on the command line and use `cd` to go to the main folder of the game (the one with the file `README.md` in it)
- Ask git to go on the `master` branch: `git checkout master` (note: if there is an error, STOP THERE and fix it, usually you need to commit some work, THINK TWICE BEFORE RUNNING `git stash`, it will more or less forget what you did (Maxence can get it back for you but please try not to do this error))
- Get the latest stuff from the `master` branch: `git pull` and then `git lfs pull`
- Actually create your new branch: `git switch -c my-super-cool-branch` (secret tip: replace `my-super-cool-branch` with the name of your new branch following this format: `[username]/[feature name]`)
- push for the first time, to create your new branch on GitHub: `git push --set-upstream origin my-super-cool-branch`
- Work
- add, commit, and so on
- push
- Create a Pull Request: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
